Excel Data Visualization Project: Bike Purchase Analysis
Overview
This project is an Excel-based data visualization analysis aimed at understanding customer behavior in relation to bike purchases. By examining various demographic, economic, and geographic factors, we aim to identify patterns and insights that may influence bike purchasing decisions. Key fields in the dataset include Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Ownership, Cars Owned, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Age Brackets, and whether the individual Purchased a Bike.

Dataset Fields
The dataset includes the following columns:

Gender: Male or Female
Income: Annual income of individuals
Children: Number of children
Education: Education level achieved
Occupation: Job role or title
Home Owner: Home ownership status
Cars: Number of cars owned
Commute Distance: Distance of daily commute
Region: Geographical region of residence
Age: Age of the individual
Age Brackets: Grouped age ranges created through feature engineering
Purchased Bike: Indicates if the individual purchased a bike
Project Goals
This project seeks to answer the following key questions through data visualization:

Income Analysis: Does income level vary between individuals who purchased a bike and those who did not?
Commuting Distance Analysis: What is the commuting distance of bike purchasers, and how does it vary by residential region?
Age Bracket Analysis: How does age bracket influence bike purchasing behavior?
Pivot Tables & Visualizations
The project consists of three main pivot tables, each aimed at addressing one of the key questions:

Pivot Table 1: Income and Bike Purchase Analysis
Purpose: Determine if there is a correlation between income levels and bike purchasing decisions.
Visualization: Bar chart
Dashboard Interactivity: Adjustable sliders for Marital Status, Region, and Education to allow further segmentation of the data.
Pivot Table 2: Commuting Distance and Bike Purchase by Region
Purpose: Analyze the commute distances for individuals who purchased a bike, segmented by residential region.
Visualization: Line chart
Insight: Helps in identifying potential bike buyers based on commuting distance.
Pivot Table 3: Age Brackets and Bike Purchase Analysis
Purpose: Evaluate bike purchasing trends across different age brackets (a feature-engineered column).
Visualization: Line chart
Interactive Dashboard
An interactive dashboard is provided for this project to enable filtering based on various criteria, allowing for a dynamic exploration of the dataset:

Filters: Sliders for Marital Status, Region, and Education
Charts: A bar chart for income analysis and line charts for commuting distance and age bracket analysis.
Getting Started
Open the Excel file to view and interact with the pivot tables and charts.
Use the filters to refine the insights based on demographic and geographic criteria.
Observe the visualizations to draw insights and understand the trends and patterns in bike purchases across various demographics.
Conclusion
This analysis will provide valuable insights into which factors most strongly correlate with bike purchases, allowing for data-driven decisions in marketing and customer segmentation.
